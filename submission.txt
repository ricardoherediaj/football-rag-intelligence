PROJECT: Football RAG Intelligence

Hugging Face Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rheredia8/football-rag-intelligence
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/rheredia8/football-rag-intelligence

=============================================================================

REQUIRED FEATURES ✅

✅ RAG system with retrieval + generation (LlamaIndex + ChromaDB)
✅ Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini)
✅ Deployed to Hugging Face Spaces (live and running)
✅ Cost < $0.50 for full demo (~$0.01 per 100 queries with Claude Haiku)
✅ API key security (in-memory only, never stored)
✅ Comprehensive README with architecture, cost estimation, examples

=============================================================================

OPTIONAL FEATURES (7/5 required) ✅

1. RAG evaluation code & results (100% retrieval, 99.4% faithfulness, 95% insight)
2. Domain-specific application (football tactical analysis, not generic AI tutor)
3. 2+ data sources (WhoScored + Fotmob with cross-source mapping)
4. Structured JSON outputs (Pydantic-validated ETL pipeline)
5. Metadata filtering (100% retrieval accuracy vs 70% semantic-only)
6. Query routing (text analysis vs visualization routing)
7. Function calling (6 visualization types, $0 cost)

=============================================================================

HOW TO TEST

1. Visit: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rheredia8/football-rag-intelligence
2. Enter your API key (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini)
3. Try: "What was PSV's pressing strategy against Ajax?"
4. Try: "Show dashboard for Heracles vs PEC Zwolle"
