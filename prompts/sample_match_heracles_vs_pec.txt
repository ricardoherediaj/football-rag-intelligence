**Required Analysis:**

6. **Actionable Recommendations**: What should coaches focus on based on this data?

===========================================
INTERESTING INSIGHTS TO LOOK FOR:
===========================================

1. **Massive xG Overperformance by PEC Zwolle**
   - Only 1.14 xG but scored 8 goals = 7x overperformance!
   - Only 7 shots total, 6 on target, 6 goals = 85.7% conversion
   - This is statistically extraordinary

2. **Heracles Underperformance**
   - 4.51 xG but only scored 2 goals = 2.51 xG wasted
   - 24 shots, 15 on target, only 2 goals = 8.3% conversion

3. **Tactical Dominance by PEC**
   - 101 progressive passes vs 55 (nearly double)
   - Aggressive pressing: 16 high press events vs 2
   - Low PPDA of 2.95 = intense pressure
   - Advanced positioning: 55.9m vs 35.2m median

4. **Heracles Sat Deep**
   - Median position only 35.2m (very defensive)
   - Defense line at 23.5m (parking the bus)
   - Only 2 high press events (no pressure)

5. **The Paradox**
   - Heracles had MORE shots (24 vs 7)
   - Heracles had HIGHER xG (4.51 vs 1.14)
   - But PEC won 8-2!
   - This suggests: clinical finishing beats shot volume

===========================================
EXPECTED QUALITY ANALYSIS SHOULD INCLUDE:
===========================================

✓ References to the xG overperformance (most important insight)
✓ Comparison of pressing intensity (16 vs 2 events, PPDA difference)
✓ Progressive passing dominance (101 vs 55)
✓ Positional dominance (55.9m vs 35.2m)
✓ Explanation of how PEC won despite lower xG
✓ Tactical approach: PEC dominated possession and territory
✓ Clinical finishing: 7 shots, 6 goals is extraordinary efficiency

✗ Generic statements like "PEC played better"
✗ Ignoring the xG data
✗ Not mentioning the statistical anomaly (8 goals from 1.14 xG)
✗ Failing to explain the paradox (more shots/xG but still lost)
